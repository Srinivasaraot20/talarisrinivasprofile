**Regarding Website Issues & Functionality:**

Based on your description, here's a summary of the issues and potential solutions:

*   **"After 'click learn more' in home page contain error Internal Server Error":** This is a backend issue. The server is failing to process the request when someone clicks "learn more." **Action:** This needs to be investigated by a developer. The server logs need to be checked to identify the specific error causing the 500 Internal Server Error. Common causes include:
    *   Database connection problems
    *   Coding errors in the "learn more" page's logic
    *   Missing files or dependencies
    *   Server overload
    * Insufficient server specifications.
*   **Resume section is not working":** This means the resume section isn't loading/ displaying properly. **Action:** You need to debug this. Check:
    *   Is the link to the resume file correct?
    *   Is the file format supported by the browser (PDF is usually best)?
    *   Is there any JavaScript error preventing the resume from loading?
    * The section of the website may not have the adequate specifications.
*   **"Gallery" title and "Gallery Categories" title are not visible:** Check the CSS and HTML code to ensure these elements are present and not hidden by styles (e.g., `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`). Also, ensure their text color contrasts sufficiently with the background.
*   **"Get In Touch" section is not visible:** Same as above. Verify the HTML and CSS. Ensure it's not hidden or improperly positioned.
*   **"After any user send message then immediately those request can be received for the respond":** You need to make sure your app configuration uses the correct email/ notification settings. Set up email or SMS notifications to alert you when a new message comes through.

**Important considerations for the developer:**

*   **Debugging:** Use browser developer tools (Network tab, Console tab) to identify the source of the errors.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling in the backend code to catch exceptions and log them for debugging.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the website after making changes to ensure all functionality is working as expected.
*   **Server Environment:** Verify the server environment meets the requirements of the application (e.g., correct PHP version, necessary extensions installed).

**Additional advice to elevate your profile:**

*   **Quantify achievements:** Whenever possible, use numbers to demonstrate the impact of your projects.  For example: "Increased user engagement by X% with the recommendation system."
*   **Keywords:**  Review job descriptions for roles you're interested in and incorporate relevant keywords into your profile (skills, experience, etc.).
*   **Tailor your About Section:** Highlight the experiences and skills that best match the jobs you want.
*   **Request Recommendations:** Ask colleagues, professors, or mentors to write recommendations for you on LinkedIn.
*   **Network:** Actively engage with relevant communities and professionals on LinkedIn. Share your insights, participate in discussions, and build connections.
* **Mobile optimization:** Consider how to make your website mobile-friendly.
